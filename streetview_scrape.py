# This version of the SimpleGoogleStreetView script addresses a bug in which
# Processing Python Mode on Windows cannot load files with the Python open()
# function. Thus, you can place your CSV locations into the 'data' variable
# in locationscsv.py instead.
#
# https://github.com/jdf/processing.py/issues/274
#
# Once the issue is resolved or a workaround found, this file will go away.
